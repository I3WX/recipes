            <p>Matar, or fresh green peas, are the center of these flaky deep-fried snacks or kachoris. They originated
                in Rajasthan, where my family is from, and I grew up eating them. Kachoris can have many different
                fillings. These particular ones are typically made when green peas are in season during winter and
                spring. The filling is lightly spiced; you donâ€™t want to smother the taste of the green peas, just
                enhance it. It makes a great leftover snack and is as delicious as cold pizza is the next day. </p>

            <p>Tandoori chicken is a dish made from chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a
                cylindrical clay oven. The dish is now popular worldwide. The modern form of the dish was popularized by
                the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi, India in the late 1940s</p>

            Kheer
            <p>kheer (Indian Rice PUdding), a chilled South Asian dessert made from slow-cooked rice, milk, and sugar,
                much like a rice pudding. It is typically flavoured with saffron, cardamom, raisins, and/or various
                nuts, notably pistachios, cashews, and almonds.</p>

            Gobi Paratha
            <p>Gobi paratha is a type of paratha or flatbread, originating from the Indian subcontinent, that is stuffed
                with flavored cauliflower and vegetables. It can be consumed as breakfast or as an appetizer.</p>

            Gulab Jamun
            <p>Decadent, sweet and delicious, a Gulab Jamun is a fried dough ball soaked in an aromatic simple syrup
                flavored with essence of rose (gulab) and infused with spices such as cardamom and saffron. It is then
                garnished with roasted nuts. One of the most popular desserts in North India, it is loved by children
                and adults alike. In India, tea is usually had sweet, sometimes so much so that we laughingly refer to
                it as having some tea with your sugar. Similarly, this ultra-sweet dessert in its traditional form is
                too sweet even for my husband's sweet tooth (who I tease, because he likes a sugary tea). Unconventional
                as it may seem, I found that the addition of alcohol in the syrup makes for a slightly less sweet syrup
                that is so delicious that you can't stop yourself from licking the spoon. </p>
