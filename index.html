            <p>Matar, or fresh green peas, are the center of these flaky deep-fried snacks or kachoris. They originated
                in Rajasthan, where my family is from, and I grew up eating them. Kachoris can have many different
                fillings. These particular ones are typically made when green peas are in season during winter and
                spring. The filling is lightly spiced; you don’t want to smother the taste of the green peas, just
                enhance it. It makes a great leftover snack and is as delicious as cold pizza is the next day. </p>

            <p>kKheer made with Rice (chawal ki kheer) doesn’t need any introduction. It’s a traditional sweet from
                Indian cuisine which is made with rice, milk, sugar, ghee and flavored with cardamom powder. In this
                recipe, the pressure cooker is used to cook the rice and then rice are cooked with milk and sugar until
                thick consistency to make the kheer. You can also use leftover rice or can cook the rice previously to
                speed up the process.</p>
