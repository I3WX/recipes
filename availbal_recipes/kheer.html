    <p>
        Kheer made with Rice (chawal ki kheer) doesn’t need any introduction. It’s a traditional sweet from Indian
        cuisine which is made with rice, milk, sugar, ghee and flavored with cardamom powder. In this recipe, the
        pressure cooker is used to cook the rice and then rice are cooked with milk and sugar until thick consistency to
        make the kheer. You can also use leftover rice or can cook the rice previously to speed up the process.

    <h1><b>Ingredients</b></h1>
    <ol>


        <li>1/2 cup basmati rice</li>

        <li>6 cup whole milk</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>

        <li>1/2 cup sager</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon rose water</li>

        <li>3 tablespoon minced unsalted pistachios</li>

    </ol>

    <h1><strong>Directions : </strong></h1>

    <ol>
        <li>n a large, heavy-bottomed pot, bring the rice, milk, and cardamom to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring
            constantly with a heat-safe spoonula to help keep the milk from burning. </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat so that the milk is gently simmering and cook for 45 to 50 minutes, stirring often. The rice
            should be tender and the milk will have reduced by half, giving a porridge-like consistency. </li>
        <li>Add the sugar, rosewater or vanilla, and pistachios. Stir and turn off the heat. Serve either warm or
            chilled, garnished with extra pistachios. Goes well with fresh fruit too. </li>
